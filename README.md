# Economics Research Repository
*Risk, Fungibility, and Irreversible Computation* 
This repository of research attempts to build on the classical foundations of institutional economics through the diligent deployment of solution solvers taken from the realm of smart-contracts, O.R., decision science, and AI. It's a study of energy optimisation in social architectures; progress through an existing order that is ludic and reckless.

## Literature Review: The Pre-History of Institutional Thermodynamics

The development of institutional theory can be viewed as an iterative discovery of the **Landauer Bound**. Where classical economists saw "friction," we identify the physical dissipation of energy required to resolve informational contradictions.

### The Thermodynamics of Transaction Costs

The foundational realisation that institutions exist to minimise exchange "friction" began with **Ronald Coase**, who identified that the market and the firm are alternative methods of coordinating production based on their respective transaction costs. From our perspective, Coase’s "costs" are the energy required for state transitions. **Oliver Williamson** expanded this into the "Economic Institutions of Capitalism," arguing that firms bundle transactions to mitigate opportunism. In our framework, this "bundling" is an energy-saving strategy: by internalizing transactions, firms avoid the high-erasure costs of repeated external contract renegotiation.

### Social Choice and the Erasure Bottleneck

The mathematical impossibility of perfectly aggregating preferences was proven by **Kenneth Arrow**, whose "Social Choice and Individual Values" demonstrated that no rank-order voting system can convert individual preferences into a community-wide ranking without violating specific fairness criteria. We interpret Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem as a thermodynamic limit: the energy required to erase the "contradictory bits" of a multi-agent system into a single consistent state often exceeds the system's budget. This logic is echoed in the work of **Buchanan and Tullock**, who analysed the "Calculus of Consent" to determine the optimal costs of collective decision-making, and **Mancur Olson**, who showed in "The Logic of Collective Action" that the "entropy" of large groups prevents coordination without specific energy inputs like selective incentives.

### Coordination Manifolds and Focal Points

**Thomas Schelling** provided the bridge to bisimulation in "The Strategy of Conflict" and "Micromotives and Macrobehavior". His concept of the "focal point" (or Schelling point) is effectively a low-energy manifold—a coordinate where agents can converge with minimal signaling erasure. This is the precursor to the **Single Negotiating Text (SNT)** architecture, where the structure of the environment does the "computational work" for the agents.

### Institutional Evolution as Energy Optimisation

The historical arc of institutions, as documented by **North and Thomas** and **Douglass North**, shows a clear trajectory toward lower-erasure substrates. In "The Rise of the Western World" and "Structure and Change in Economic History," North argues that institutional change occurs when relative price shifts make old structures energetically non-viable. Efficient property rights reduce the "erasure cost" of ownership disputes. Similarly, **Elinor Ostrom** proved in "Governing the Commons" that decentralised, modular governance can outperform centralised states by keeping the "erasure granularity" local to the resource, preventing systemic dissipation.

### Transition Vectors: Exit, Voice, and Loyalty

Finally, **Albert Hirschman** defined the fundamental transition vectors available to an agent within a failing institution.

* **Exit**: A high-erasure transition (abandoning the state).
* **Voice**: An exploratory, low-erasure computation (attempting to change the state).
* **Loyalty**: The "hysteresis" or resistance to state change.

### Summary of Theoretical Synthesis

| Classical Concept | Thermodynamic Reframing | Primary Author |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Transaction Costs** | Landauer Erasure () | Coase / Williamson |
| **Social Choice Friction** | Contradiction Erasure | Arrow / Olson |
| **Focal Points** | Low-Energy Manifolds | Schelling |
| **Institutional Change** | Topographical Optimisation | North |
| **Common-Pool Rules** | Modular Dissipation | Ostrom |

## **Implications and Extensions**

To bridge the gap between qualitative institutional history and the quantitative reality of the 2026 global economy, we must recognise that the "friction" described by the classical authors is not merely a metaphor; it is the physical manifestation of **Landauer dissipation** occurring at the scale of entire markets.

In the current 2026 landscape—characterised by hyper-liquid digital assets and algorithmic governance—the bottleneck is no longer the speed of information, but the **energy cost of information erasure**. This brings us to the formal encoding of **"Mock Fungibility."**

### The Logic of Mock Fungibility

In our framework, **Mock Fungibility** is the reversible simulation of interchangeability. While "Real Fungibility" (Definition 2.1) requires an irreversible state transition that erases the distinct identities of two assets, Mock Fungibility exists within the **bisimulation layer**.

- It allows agents to trade _as if_ assets are equivalent within a low-erasure substrate (like a mempool or a surrogate utility model).
    
- It defers the "High-Erasure" cost of final settlement until the system has achieved maximal informational certainty.
    
- In the 2026 economy, Mock Fungibility is the "grease" in automated market-makers (AMMs), allowing for "pseudo-negotiations" between fragmented liquidity pools without triggering the massive $\Delta E$ of a blockchain's final commitment layer.

## From Authors to Variables

The following table serves as the "tokenship" parser, translating the classical institutional literature into the thermodynamic variables required for our 2026 economic model.

| **Classical Token (Author)** | **Thermodynamic Variable**                          | **2026 Global Economic State**                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ronald Coase**             | **$\Delta E_{\text{trans}}$** (Total Dissipation)   | The marginal cost of erasing a transaction bit in a distributed ledger.           |
| **Kenneth Arrow**            | **$H(S)$** (Systemic Entropy)                       | The irreducible noise in decentralized preference aggregation (DAOs).             |
| **Thomas Schelling**         | **$\Phi$** (Potential Surface)                      | Algorithmic "Focal Points" where agents converge in high-frequency trading.       |
| **Douglass North**           | **$\Delta E_{\text{reset}}$** (Hysteresis)          | The "sunk cost" of legacy legal infrastructures resisting "Liquid Glass" updates. |
| **Elinor Ostrom**            | **$\epsilon_{\text{local}}$** (Modular Dissipation) | Edge-computing governance models that prevent global entropy spills.              |
| **Albert Hirschman**         | **$T \Delta S$** (Transition Heat)                  | The energy released when capital "Exits" a failing currency for a hard asset.     |

### The Transition to Mathematical Formalism

The 2026 economy is essentially a high-temperature information processor. As the frequency of transactions approaches the limit of human cognition, the "Voice" described by **Hirschman** becomes too slow and expensive to process.

We therefore move from the **Qualitative Review** (the "Why" of institutions) to the **Thermodynamic Proof** (the "How" of their physical survival). The following section uses the variables defined above to prove that a system utilizing **Mock Fungibility** (Raiffa's "surrogate" layer) creates a Pareto improvement by reducing the total $\Delta E$ of the global settlement layer.

## **Relationship to Existing Theories**

*Connection to Mechanism Design*

**Classic mechanism design** (Myerson-Satterthwaite, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) assumes:

- Agents have private valuations
- Designer elicits truthful revelation via incentives
- Mechanism computes efficient allocation

**Raiffa's approach differs:**

- Uses surrogates, not principals
- Elicits preferences through MAUT, not incentive mechanisms
- Focuses on energy reduction, not incentive compatibility

**Engergy Costs:** For bilateral negotiation with complete information, Raiffa's energy cost is lower than VCG mechanism:

Raiffa, market-making, and blockchain consensus all solve the same optimisation problem in different domains.

## Implications and Extensions

### Value Extraction Bounds

**Thermodynamically Fair Extraction:** In an unbundled system, value extracted at layer i is bounded by:

$$V_i \leq k_{\text{market}} \cdot (\Delta E_{\text{baseline}} - \Delta E_{\text{layer } i})$$

where k_market is a market efficiency constant. (Theorem Market 1)

**Proof:** Extractable value derives from energy reduction provided. In competitive markets, surplus is competed away to marginal cost. Therefore V_i ≤ energy saved. □

**Corollary:** Monopolistic rent extraction violates thermodynamic fairness:

$$\text{If } V_i > \Delta E_{\text{saved}}, \text{ then extraction is rent-seeking}$$

### Blockchain Store-of-Value Reframing

**SoV Equivalence:** Gold, fiat, and Bitcoin are thermodynamically equivalent stores of value with different erasure mechanisms: (Theorem Market 2)

| System  | Erasure Mechanism       | ΔE_reversal             |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Gold    | Physical scarcity       | Geological + extraction |
| Fiat    | State enforcement       | Political + military    |
| Bitcoin | Cryptographic consensus | Computational (PoW × 6) |

**Proof:** All three make state reversal expensive through different physical processes. None has "intrinsic value"—all are social agreements with engineered high erasure costs. □

### Future Work

1. **Quantitative measurement** of k_cognitive in real negotiations
2. **Optimal layer count** for given problem complexity
3. **Multi-party extensions** beyond bilateral Raiffa framework
4. **Dynamic fungibility** where α-values evolve with market conditions
5. **Cross-domain bisimulation** (e.g., legal contracts → smart contracts)

---

## Conclusion

I have presented a unified thermodynamic theory of institutional design with four main results:

1. **Multi-fungibility is entropy minimisation** under transitivity constraints (§2)
2. **Raiffa's architecture achieves provable energy reduction** through preference externalisation (§3)
3. **Bisimulation formalizes why surrogates work** at lower cost than principals (§4)
4. **Marlowe implements this with verified properties** (termination, money conservation) (§5)

The key insight: **value accrues to whoever controls the lowest-energy transformation layer that the system depends on.** This explains why:

- Market makers capture more value than asset issuers
- Blockchain miners extract fees proportional to security provided
- Analytical intervenors enable agreements that would otherwise fail

Future institutions will compete on thermodynamic efficiency, not just allocative efficiency. Those that minimize ΔE_total while preserving behavioral outcomes will dominate.

**The hegemony of language, law, and ledgers rests on their ability to engineer differential erasure costs. Whoever builds the next low-energy substrate becomes the new infrastructure.**

## **Landauer Thesis**

I present a unified theory of institutional efficiency grounded in information thermodynamics. Landauer's principle establishes that erasing one bit of information dissipates at minimum ΔE ≥ kT ln(2), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. This physical bound constrains all information-processing systems, including economic and social institutions.

## Institutional Efficiency

Institutional efficiency is grounded in information thermodynamics. Value systems are information-processing architectures where institutional design determines the energy cost of state transitions. Systems that externalise exploratory computation into low-erasure substrates outperform those that bind exploration directly to high-erasure commitments. This principle can be formalised through Raiffa's negotiation architecture, demonstrate its application to multi-fungibility optimisation, and prove its implementation in Marlowe smart contracts via bisimulation. This framework reveals why certain institutional structures—from market-making to blockchain consensus—converge on similar thermodynamic topologies despite operating in different domains.
