## **Landauer Thesis**

I present a unified theory of institutional efficiency grounded in information thermodynamics. Landauer's principle establishes that erasing one bit of information dissipates at minimum ΔE ≥ kT ln(2), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. This physical bound constrains all information-processing systems, including economic and social institutions.

## Institutional Efficiency

Institutional efficiency is grounded in information thermodynamics. Value systems are information-processing architectures where institutional design determines the energy cost of state transitions. Systems that externalize exploratory computation into low-erasure substrates outperform those that bind exploration directly to high-erasure commitments. This principle can be formalised through Raiffa's negotiation architecture, demonstrate its application to multi-fungibility optimization, and prove its implementation in Marlowe smart contracts via bisimulation. This framework reveals why certain institutional structures—from market-making to blockchain consensus—converge on similar thermodynamic topologies despite operating in different domains.
