*Risk, Fungibility, and Irreversible Computation* 
This repository of research attempts to build on the classical foundations of institutional economics through the diligent deployment of solution solvers taken from the realm of smart-contracts, O.R., decision science, and AI. It's a study of energy optimization in social architectures; progress through an existing order that is ludic and reckless.

## Literature Review: The Pre-History of Institutional Thermodynamics

The development of institutional theory can be viewed as an iterative discovery of the **Landauer Bound**. Where classical economists saw "friction," we identify the physical dissipation of energy required to resolve informational contradictions.

### The Thermodynamics of Transaction Costs

The foundational realization that institutions exist to minimize exchange "friction" began with **Ronald Coase**, who identified that the market and the firm are alternative methods of coordinating production based on their respective transaction costs. From our perspective, Coase’s "costs" are the energy required for state transitions. **Oliver Williamson** expanded this into the "Economic Institutions of Capitalism," arguing that firms bundle transactions to mitigate opportunism. In our framework, this "bundling" is an energy-saving strategy: by internalizing transactions, firms avoid the high-erasure costs of repeated external contract renegotiation.

### Social Choice and the Erasure Bottleneck

The mathematical impossibility of perfectly aggregating preferences was proven by **Kenneth Arrow**, whose "Social Choice and Individual Values" demonstrated that no rank-order voting system can convert individual preferences into a community-wide ranking without violating specific fairness criteria. We interpret Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem as a thermodynamic limit: the energy required to erase the "contradictory bits" of a multi-agent system into a single consistent state often exceeds the system's budget. This logic is echoed in the work of **Buchanan and Tullock**, who analyzed the "Calculus of Consent" to determine the optimal costs of collective decision-making, and **Mancur Olson**, who showed in "The Logic of Collective Action" that the "entropy" of large groups prevents coordination without specific energy inputs like selective incentives.

### Coordination Manifolds and Focal Points

**Thomas Schelling** provided the bridge to bisimulation in "The Strategy of Conflict" and "Micromotives and Macrobehavior". His concept of the "focal point" (or Schelling point) is effectively a low-energy manifold—a coordinate where agents can converge with minimal signaling erasure. This is the precursor to the **Single Negotiating Text (SNT)** architecture, where the structure of the environment does the "computational work" for the agents.

### Institutional Evolution as Energy Optimization

The historical arc of institutions, as documented by **North and Thomas** and **Douglass North**, shows a clear trajectory toward lower-erasure substrates. In "The Rise of the Western World" and "Structure and Change in Economic History," North argues that institutional change occurs when relative price shifts make old structures energetically non-viable. Efficient property rights reduce the "erasure cost" of ownership disputes. Similarly, **Elinor Ostrom** proved in "Governing the Commons" that decentralized, modular governance can outperform centralized states by keeping the "erasure granularity" local to the resource, preventing systemic dissipation.

### Transition Vectors: Exit, Voice, and Loyalty

Finally, **Albert Hirschman** defined the fundamental transition vectors available to an agent within a failing institution.

* **Exit**: A high-erasure transition (abandoning the state).
* **Voice**: An exploratory, low-erasure computation (attempting to change the state).
* **Loyalty**: The "hysteresis" or resistance to state change.

## **Landauer Thesis**

I present a unified theory of institutional efficiency grounded in information thermodynamics. Landauer's principle establishes that erasing one bit of information dissipates at minimum ΔE ≥ kT ln(2), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. This physical bound constrains all information-processing systems, including economic and social institutions.

## Institutional Efficiency

Institutional efficiency is grounded in information thermodynamics. Value systems are information-processing architectures where institutional design determines the energy cost of state transitions. Systems that externalize exploratory computation into low-erasure substrates outperform those that bind exploration directly to high-erasure commitments. This principle can be formalised through Raiffa's negotiation architecture, demonstrate its application to multi-fungibility optimization, and prove its implementation in Marlowe smart contracts via bisimulation. This framework reveals why certain institutional structures—from market-making to blockchain consensus—converge on similar thermodynamic topologies despite operating in different domains.
